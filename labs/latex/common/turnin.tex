\subsection*{Turn-in instructions}
Create a personal Git repository on GitHub named ``Lab\labnumber-username'', where \verb!username! is your Kerberos username, and commit the following files to it:
\begin{itemize}
\item Edited project files from \productname (if any)
\item A PDF file with the answers to each question \textit{clearly marked}. When you have completed this lab, you will have answered \total{questions} questions.
\item A \verb!who.txt! file with your name. If you worked with someone else, include their name in the \verb!who.txt! file.
\end{itemize}

Once committed, push all files to GitHub. You may work with a partner, as long as each of you pushes your own copy of all of the listed files. Note that files submitted via ANGEL, email, or other methods will receive zero credit. In addition, files that cannot be accessed without additional work (e.g. zip files, LaTeX documents that require compiling) will lose you points. After you push your files to GitHub, please complete the feedback survey on Angel Under Labs - Labs Anonymous Feedback!
